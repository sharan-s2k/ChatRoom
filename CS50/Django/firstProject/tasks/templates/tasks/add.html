        <!-- It works by adding a hidden input field to your form that contains a token. -->
        <!-- This token is unique to your session and is checked by Django when you submit the form. -->

        <!-- This means that it is unique to you and cannot be guessed by an attacker. -->
        <!-- The token is also short-lived and will expire after a certain amount of time. -->
        <!-- This means that an attacker cannot use an old token to submit a form on your behalf. -->

<!-- However Django provides a shortcut to create a form using the forms module.
This is done by creating a class that inherits from the django.forms.Form class. -->
