            # HttpResponseRedirect is better because it will prevent the user from accidentally resubmitting the form if they refresh the page.

# The Problem with render()
# When you use render() after a form submission, the browser's last action is the POST request that submitted the data. If the user refreshes the page, the browser tries to resend that same POST request, which can cause duplicate data (like adding the same task twice).

# The Solution with HttpResponseRedirect
# When you use HttpResponseRedirect, the server tells the browser, "Okay, I got your data. Now go to this new URL." The browser then makes a new GET request to that URL. The browser's last action is now a safe GET request. If the user refreshes, it just re-requests the page without resubmitting the form.

# In Short
# render() keeps the last browser action as a POST (unsafe to repeat), while HttpResponseRedirect changes it to a GET (safe to repeat).
